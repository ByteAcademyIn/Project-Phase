# Project Options for Data Science
				

**Predict popularity of listing on NoBroker.com**       
*Tags: Numerical Prediction, NLP, Real-Estate, Scraping-Required*

*Description:*
1) Task: Predict interest level of a rental listing on nobroker.com
2) Target variable: Number of times listing was shortlisted. 
3) Attributes: Must be scraped from the site but should include the description 
4) Evaluation: Hold out 20-30% of data for testing and minimise the RMSE

**Prediction using Lending Club data**       
*Tags: Finance, Classification, No-scraping Required*

*Description:*
1) Tasks: The data on Lending club can be used to predict different targets:
-  Predict borrower’s default probability
-  Predict probability of a loan being accepted/decline     
2) Attributes: Choose most relevant attributes out of 115 potential options         
3) Evaluation: Attain highest precision/recall using 20-30% for testing high and/or high AUCROC if predicting accepted/decline. If predicting probability, minimise RMSE.

**Predict mortality of patients in ICU**          
*Tags: Medical, Health Care, Binary-Classification, No-scraping required*

1) Based on the 2012 challenge on Physionet         
2) Target Variable: Survival (0), death (1)                
3) Evaluation: Attain highest precision/recall using 20-30% for testing high and/or high AUCROC         

**Build a recommendation engine (AKA The Netflix Prize)**        
*Tags: Recommendation, Netflix, No-scraping required*

1) Utilise the industry-standard collaborative filtering algorithm.        
2) Evaluation: Get the lowest possible Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
